### 2. Performance Tracker (`PerformanceTracker.js`)
- **Multi-Dimensional Metrics**: Tracks combat, movement, survival, and skill performance
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Balanced evaluation across different gameplay aspects
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Continuous performance monitoring with historical context
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Smart calculation of reaction time, decision quality, and adaptability

**Tracked Metrics:**
- **Combat**: Hit accuracy, zombie kills, combo multipliers, damage dealt/taken
- **Movement**: Average speed, distance traveled, time stuck, collision count
- **Survival**: Health percentage, survival time, objectives completed, resource efficiency
- **Skill**: Reaction time, decision quality, adaptability to changing conditions

### 3. Intelligent Spawn Manager (`IntelligentSpawnManager.js`)
- **Pattern-Based Spawning**: Four distinct spawn patterns with difficulty-based weighting
- **Contextual Zombie Selection**: Smart zombie type selection based on situation and difficulty
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Spawn positioning that considers player movement and game state
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient spawn management with cleanup and statistics

**Spawn Patterns:**
- **Scattered**: Random spawns around player area (40% base weight)
- **Clustered**: Concentrated group spawns (30% base weight)
- **Ambush**: Predictive spawns ahead of player movement (20% base weight)
- **Swarm**: Large coordinated group attacks (10% base weight)

**Zombie Types:**
- **Normal**: Standard zombies (70% base probability)
- **Fast**: Quick-moving zombies (20% base probability)
- **Heavy**: Tough, slow zombies (8% base probability)
- **Special**: Unique ability zombies (2% base probability)

### 4. Boss Zombie Manager (`BossZombieManager.js`)
- **Diverse Boss Types**: Four unique boss zombies with special abilities
- **Intelligent AI**: Behavior trees and state machines for complex boss behavior
- **Ability System**: Cooldown-based special abilities with strategic usage
- **Enrage Mechanics**: Dynamic behavior changes at low health
- **Spawn Management**: Difficulty-based boss spawning with cooldown systems

**Boss Types:**
- **Brute**: High health, devastating melee attacks (Charge, Ground Slam, Intimidate)
- **Spitter**: Ranged acid attacks (Acid Spit, Acid Pool, Corrosive Aura)
- **Screamer**: Support zombie that buffs others (Sonic Scream, Zombie Rally, Fear Aura)
- **Exploder**: Suicide bomber with massive damage (Explosive Charge, Toxic Explosion, Chain Reaction)

### 5. Environmental Hazard Manager (`EnvironmentalHazardManager.js`)
- **Dynamic Hazard System**: Multiple hazard types with different trigger mechanisms
- **Interactive Environment**: Environmental storytelling through hazard placement
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Hazard frequency and intensity scale with difficulty
- **Warning Systems**: Player feedback for dangerous environmental elements

**Hazard Types:**
- **Explosive Barrels**: Collision-triggered area damage
- **Acid Pools**: Proximity-based continuous damage
- **Spike Traps**: Hidden pressure-activated tire damage
- **Fire Hazards**: Environmental area denial
- **Collapsing Structures**: Timed massive damage with warning period

## Technical Architecture
