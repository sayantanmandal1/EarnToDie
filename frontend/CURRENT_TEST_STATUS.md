# Current Test Status - Comprehensive Fix Progress

## âœ… Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Enhanced WebGL Context Mocking**: Added missing `clearStencil` method and comprehensive WebGL API coverage
- **Improved Canvas Context Mocking**: Added full 2D canvas context with proper error handling for test environments
- **Enhanced Audio Context Mocking**: Added complete AudioContext API with proper listener and buffer source mocking
- **Vector3 Mock Improvements**: Fixed Vector3 clone and copy methods to work properly with spatial audio

### 2. Critical System Fixes
- **SpatialAudio System**: Fixed Vector3 mocking issues, audio buffer handling, and position updates (30/32 tests passing)
- **PerformanceManager**: Added missing dispose method and fixed GPU detection null handling
- **SaveAPI**: Fixed offline queue handling and smart sync logic for undefined server data
- **AssetLoader**: Added canvas context null checks for test environments
- **GameSystemsIntegration**: Added proper physics mock to game engine
- **Checkpoint**: Enhanced Three.js mesh position mocking

### 3. Network and Offline Handling
- **Robust API Clients**: Fixed offline queue processing and timeout issues
- **Error Handling**: Improved error constructor property handling and recovery strategies
- **Performance Degradation**: Fixed GPU detection and quality adjustment logic
