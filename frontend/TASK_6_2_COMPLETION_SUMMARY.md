## Technical Implementation

### HUD System Architecture
```javascript
// Real-time data processing
- Health/armor monitoring with visual feedback
- Vehicle status tracking (speed, fuel, health, gear)
- Combat state management (weapons, ammo, crosshair)
- Minimap rendering with canvas optimization
- Damage indicator system with directional arrows
- Notification queue management
```

### Pause Menu System
```javascript
// State management
- Menu navigation with keyboard/mouse support
- Save/load system with localStorage integration
- Confirmation dialog system
- Audio feedback integration
- Settings preservation
```

### Canvas Minimap Implementation
- Real-time rendering of game world
- Player position and rotation tracking
- Enemy/objective/item visualization
- Efficient drawing with proper scaling
- Performance optimization with frame limiting

- **Memory Cleanup**: Proper component unmounting

## Integration Points

### Game State Integration
```javascript
// HUD receives real-time game data
- playerData: { health, armor, recentDamage }
- vehicleData: { speed, fuel, health, gear, rpm }
- combatData: { ammo, weapon, hits, combat state }
- gameState: { objectives, enemies, items, notifications }
```

### Audio System Integration
```javascript
// Audio feedback for all interactions
- HUD notifications and alerts
- Menu navigation sounds
- Damage and hit feedback
- Save/load confirmations
```

### Settings Integration
```javascript
// Customizable HUD behavior
- Scale and opacity settings
- Layout preferences
- Advanced info display
- Animation toggles
```
