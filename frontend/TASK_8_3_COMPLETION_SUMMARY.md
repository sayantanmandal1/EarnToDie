- **Checksum Verification**: Compares calculated checksums with stored values
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data types match expected formats

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Automatic Recovery**: Detects corruption and automatically initiates recovery
- **Pre-Recovery Backup**: Creates backup of current state before recovery
- **Integrity Verification**: Validates backup integrity before recovery

- **Integrity Protection**: Checksums and validation for imported saves
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains game version, player info, and export metadata
- **File Handling**: Browser-based file download/upload with proper MIME types

### Cloud Synchronization
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for multiple cloud storage providers
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and provider-specific authentication flows
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple strategies (newest, manual, merge) for handling conflicts
- **Network Awareness**: Automatic pause/resume based on connectivity
