# Vehicle Upgrade Shop and Enhancement System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive vehicle upgrade system for the Zombie Car Game, including:

1. **UpgradeShop Class** - Handles upgrade purchases, cost calculations, and upgrade effects
2. **VehicleVisualEnhancer Class** - Manages visual representation of upgrades on vehicles
3. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Unit tests and integration tests for all functionality
4. **Interactive Demo** - Visual demonstration of the upgrade system

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. UpgradeShop Class (`frontend/src/upgrades/UpgradeShop.js`)

#### Key Features:
- **Five Upgrade Categories**: Engine, Fuel, Armor, Weapon, Wheels
- **Exponential Cost Scaling**: Costs increase by 1.5x per level
- **Visual Enhancement Tracking**: Tracks what visual changes each upgrade provides
- **Performance Impact Calculation**: Shows how upgrades affect vehicle performance
- **Upgrade Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions based on player behavior
- **Event System**: Emits events when upgrades are purchased
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting upgrades with partial refund

#### Upgrade Categories:
- **Engine**: Increases acceleration, top speed, and fuel consumption
- **Fuel**: Increases fuel capacity and improves efficiency
- **Armor**: Reduces damage taken and adds visual armor plating
- **Weapon**: Increases zombie destruction power and adds mounted weapons
- **Wheels**: Improves handling, traction, and stability

#### Cost Structure:
- Base costs: Engine ($100), Fuel ($80), Armor ($120), Weapon ($150), Wheels ($90)
- Each level costs: `baseCost * (1.5 ^ currentLevel)`
- Maximum 5 levels per category

### 2. VehicleVisualEnhancer Class (`frontend/src/upgrades/VehicleVisualEnhancer.js`)

#### Visual Enhancements by Category:

**Engine Upgrades:**
- Level 1+: Enhanced exhaust system with smoke effects
- Level 3+: Turbo charger with intake pipes
- Level 4+: Hood scoop with air intake grilles

**Fuel Upgrades:**
- Level 3+: External fuel tanks on vehicle sides
- Level 4+: Fuel caps and connecting lines

**Armor Upgrades:**
- Level 1+: Side armor plating
- Level 2+: Reinforced front bumper
- Level 3+: Bumper spikes and armor rivets
- Level 4+: Protective roll cage

**Weapon Upgrades:**
- Level 1+: Roof-mounted gun with barrel
- Level 2+: Muzzle brake system
- Level 3+: Rotating gun turret and side weapons
- Level 4+: Dual barrel weapon system
- Level 5: Front-mounted machine guns

**Wheel Upgrades:**
- Level 2+: Enhanced wheel wells
- Level 3+: Fender flares

#### Special Effects:
- **Engine Glow**: Orange glow effects when throttling with high engine upgrades
- **Weapon Glow**: Red glow effects for high-level weapon systems

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Vehicle System Integration:
- Upgrades automatically apply to vehicle performance metrics
- Fuel capacity and consumption rates are modified
- Damage reduction calculations include armor upgrades
- Visual appearance reflects current upgrade levels

#### Save System Integration:
- All upgrades persist across game sessions
- Upgrade costs are deducted from player money
- Reset functionality provides 75% refund

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Acceleration**: Affected by engine and wheel upgrades
- **Top Speed**: Primarily engine upgrades
- **Handling**: Wheel upgrades improve vehicle control
- **Durability**: Armor upgrades reduce damage taken
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Fuel upgrades improve consumption rates

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (`frontend/src/upgrades/__tests__/`)

1. **UpgradeShop.test.js** (41 tests)
   - Cost calculations and exponential scaling
   - Upgrade purchase validation and error handling
   - Visual change tracking
   - Performance impact calculations
   - Event system functionality
   - Edge cases and error conditions

2. **VehicleVisualEnhancer.test.js** (44 tests)
   - Visual rendering for all upgrade categories
   - Canvas drawing operations validation
   - Glow effects and special visual features
   - Integration with different upgrade levels
   - Cache management and performance

3. **UpgradeSystemIntegration.test.js** (Integration tests)
   - Complete upgrade workflow testing
   - Save/load persistence
   - Vehicle system integration
   - Performance under stress conditions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Upgrade Purchase:
```javascript
const upgradeShop = new UpgradeShop(saveManager);

// Purchase an engine upgrade
try {
    const result = upgradeShop.purchaseUpgrade('STARTER_CAR', 'engine');
    console.log(`Upgraded to level ${result.newLevel} for $${result.cost}`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Upgrade failed:', error.message);
}
```

### Visual Enhancement Application:
```javascript
const visualEnhancer = new VehicleVisualEnhancer();
const vehicle = vehicleSystem.getVehicle('STARTER_CAR');
const upgrades = vehicle.getCurrentUpgrades();

// Apply visual enhancements to canvas
visualEnhancer.applyEnhancements(ctx, vehicle, upgrades, position, rotation);
```

### Getting Upgrade Information:
```javascript
// Get detailed upgrade information
const info = upgradeShop.getUpgradeInfo('STARTER_CAR', 'engine');
console.log(`Current level: ${info.currentLevel}`);
console.log(`Upgrade cost: $${info.cost}`);
console.log(`Can afford: ${info.canAfford.canUpgrade}`);
```

## Demo Application

The interactive demo (`frontend/public/upgrade-system-demo.html`) showcases:
- Real-time visual updates as upgrades are purchased
- Cost calculations and affordability checks
- Performance metric changes
- Visual enhancement rendering
- Complete upgrade workflow

### Demo Features:
- Add money to test different scenarios
- Purchase individual upgrades
- Reset all upgrades
- Max all upgrades instantly
- Real-time vehicle rendering with visual enhancements

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features:
- **Caching System**: Visual enhancements are cached for performance
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only renders necessary visual elements
- **Event-Driven Updates**: UI updates only when upgrades change
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources

### Scalability:
- Easy to add new upgrade categories
- Configurable cost structures
- Extensible visual enhancement system
- Modular architecture for future features

## Requirements Compliance

This implementation fully satisfies all task requirements:

✅ **UpgradeShop class with categories** - Engine, fuel, wheels, weaponry, and armor  
✅ **Exponential pricing** - 1.5x cost multiplier per level  
✅ **Visual representation** - Comprehensive visual enhancements for all categories  
✅ **Performance effects** - All upgrades improve vehicle performance  
✅ **Upgrade persistence** - Tied to individual vehicle types in save system  
✅ **Unit tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality  

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- **Upgrade Trees**: Branching upgrade paths with prerequisites
- **Temporary Upgrades**: Time-limited or consumable enhancements
- **Upgrade Combinations**: Synergy effects between different categories
- **Visual Customization**: Player-selectable visual styles for upgrades
- **Upgrade Materials**: Resource-based upgrade system beyond just money
