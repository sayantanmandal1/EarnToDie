# Zombie Car Game - Production Deployment

## Quick Start

1. **Start the game:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Access the game:**
   - Game: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:8080
   - Monitoring: http://localhost:3001

3. **Stop the game:**
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```

## System Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- 4GB RAM minimum
- 2GB disk space
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

## Configuration

Edit `.env` file to customize:
- Database settings
- API endpoints
- Security keys
- Performance settings

## Monitoring

- Grafana dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- Prometheus metrics: http://localhost:9090
- Application logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port conflicts:** Change ports in docker-compose.yml
2. **Database issues:** Check postgres logs with `docker-compose logs postgres`
3. **Performance issues:** Adjust quality settings in game options
4. **Browser compatibility:** Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari with WebGL enabled

## Game Features

- 12+ unique vehicles with upgrade systems
- 20+ zombie types with AI behaviors
- Multiple levels with procedural terrain
- Complete scoring and achievement system
- Save/load functionality with cloud sync
- Spatial audio and dynamic music
- Performance optimization for various devices
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Support

For issues or questions, check the logs and ensure all services are running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs
```
