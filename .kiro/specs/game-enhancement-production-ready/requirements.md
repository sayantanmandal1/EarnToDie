2. WHEN zombies spawn THEN the system SHALL use intelligent AI patterns based on real game design principles
3. WHEN objectives are presented THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful goals with real rewards
4. WHEN the player progresses THEN the system SHALL increase difficulty using balanced scaling algorithms
5. WHEN environmental hazards appear THEN the system SHALL implement realistic physics interactions

### Requirement 5: Complete Combat System

**User Story:** As a player, I want engaging combat with zombies that feels responsive and impactful, so that the core gameplay loop is satisfying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player hits zombies THEN the system SHALL calculate damage using realistic physics and collision detection
2. WHEN zombies attack the vehicle THEN the system SHALL apply damage with visual and audio feedback
3. WHEN explosions occur THEN the system SHALL create realistic particle effects and area damage
4. WHEN combo multipliers activate THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and meaningful score bonuses
5. WHEN special abilities are used THEN the system SHALL implement balanced cooldowns and effects

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly on various devices without lag or stuttering, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs on low-end devices THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS
2. WHEN many objects are on screen THEN the system SHALL use efficient rendering techniques
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL not cause performance degradation
4. WHEN the player adjusts quality settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring restart
5. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection and asset cleanup

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to handle errors gracefully and recover from issues, so that my gaming experience is not interrupted by technical problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff
2. WHEN assets fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide fallbacks or alternative content
3. WHEN the game crashes THEN the system SHALL save progress and offer recovery options
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust quality settings
5. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL restore from backups or reset gracefully

### Requirement 8: User Interface Polish

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive and polished user interface that provides clear feedback and easy navigation, so that I can focus on gameplay rather than struggling with controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player navigates menus THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and clear visual feedback
2. WHEN game statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show accurate, real-time information
3. WHEN the player customizes settings THEN the system SHALL provide immediate preview of changes
4. WHEN notifications appear THEN the system SHALL use non-intrusive, contextually appropriate messaging
5. WHEN the player needs help THEN the system SHALL provide accessible tutorials and guidance

### Requirement 9: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play the game on different devices and browsers, so that I can enjoy the game regardless of my platform choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game runs on different browsers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality
2. WHEN played on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt controls and UI appropriately
3. WHEN screen sizes vary THEN the system SHALL scale the interface responsively
4. WHEN different input methods are used THEN the system SHALL support keyboard, mouse, and touch controls
5. WHEN browser capabilities differ THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade features while maintaining core gameplay
