# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a 2D side-scrolling vehicle upgrade survival game set in a post-apocalyptic desert environment. Players start with a basic, run-down car and drive from left to right through a desolate, zombie-infested wasteland toward a distant safe zone. The core gameplay loop involves daily runs where players drive as far as possible until fuel runs out or the vehicle is destroyed, earning money to purchase upgrades and new vehicles between runs. The game features semi-realistic 2D physics, uneven terrain, and a distinctive post-apocalyptic visual style with dusty desert backgrounds and orange-hued skies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Daily Run Mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want to drive my vehicle from left to right through a zombie-infested desert wasteland each day, so that I can earn money to upgrade my vehicle and eventually reach the safe zone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player starts a daily run THEN the system SHALL spawn the player's vehicle at the left side of the level
2. WHEN the player uses controls THEN the vehicle SHALL move right with acceleration and tilting controls for mid-air maneuvering
3. WHEN the vehicle runs out of fuel OR is destroyed THEN the system SHALL end the run and calculate distance traveled
4. WHEN a run ends THEN the system SHALL convert distance traveled into money for upgrades
5. WHEN the player reaches the far end of a stage THEN the system SHALL unlock the next stage

### Requirement 2: Vehicle System and Progression

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start with a basic, old, run-down car and unlock new vehicles with unique base stats and upgrade paths, so that I can progress through increasingly difficult stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player starts the game THEN the system SHALL provide a basic starter car with minimal stats
2. WHEN the player has sufficient money THEN the system SHALL allow purchase of new vehicle types
3. WHEN a new vehicle is unlocked THEN it SHALL have unique base stats for engine power, fuel capacity, armor, and weaponry
4. WHEN the player selects a vehicle THEN each SHALL have its own independent upgrade progression path
5. WHEN vehicles are displayed THEN they SHALL show visual wear and weathering appropriate to the post-apocalyptic setting

### Requirement 3: Zombie Obstacles and Combat

**User Story:** As a player, I want to encounter zombies that slow my vehicle on impact unless destroyed by weapons, so that I must balance speed with combat effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN zombies appear along the track THEN they SHALL slow the vehicle on impact unless destroyed
2. WHEN the vehicle has weapons THEN zombies SHALL be destroyable for continued progress
3. WHEN zombies are hit THEN they SHALL be animated to flail and show impact feedback
4. WHEN zombies are destroyed THEN they SHALL produce satisfying visual and audio effects
5. WHEN progressing through stages THEN zombie density SHALL increase to match difficulty progression

### Requirement 4: Vehicle Upgrade System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to spend money earned from runs on vehicle upgrades including engine power, fuel tank size, wheels, weaponry, and armor plating, so that I can improve my vehicle's performance for longer runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses the upgrade shop THEN the system SHALL display categories for engine, fuel tank, wheels, weapons, and armor
2. WHEN the player purchases an upgrade THEN it SHALL visibly improve the vehicle's performance and appearance
3. WHEN engine upgrades are applied THEN the vehicle SHALL have increased acceleration and top speed
4. WHEN fuel tank upgrades are purchased THEN the vehicle SHALL be able to travel further before running out of fuel
5. WHEN weapon upgrades are installed THEN the vehicle SHALL have roof-mounted guns or other weaponry for zombie destruction

### Requirement 5: Distance-Based Progression and Currency

**User Story:** As a player, I want to earn money based on the distance I travel in each run, so that I can purchase upgrades and new vehicles to progress further.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a run ends THEN the system SHALL calculate total distance traveled from the starting position
2. WHEN distance is calculated THEN it SHALL be converted to money at a consistent rate
3. WHEN money is earned THEN it SHALL be added to the player's persistent currency balance
4. WHEN the player spends money THEN it SHALL be deducted from their balance and saved
5. WHEN the player reaches certain distance milestones THEN bonus money SHALL be awarded

### Requirement 6: Desert Terrain and Physics

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate uneven desert terrain with hills, ramps, dips, wreckage, and debris using semi-realistic 2D physics, so that driving feels challenging and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vehicle moves THEN it SHALL exhibit semi-realistic 2D physics with momentum and gravity
2. WHEN the vehicle encounters terrain THEN it SHALL respond with wheel suspension bounce and realistic movement
3. WHEN the vehicle is airborne THEN the player SHALL be able to control vehicle rotation and tilting
4. WHEN the vehicle hits debris or obstacles THEN it SHALL reduce speed or stop the player entirely
5. WHEN terrain is generated THEN it SHALL include hills, ramps, dips, wrecked cars, and other desert obstacles

### Requirement 7: Post-Apocalyptic Visual Style

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience a distinctive post-apocalyptic aesthetic with dusty desert backgrounds, orange-hued skies, and weathered vehicles, so that the game creates an immersive wasteland atmosphere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game renders THEN it SHALL display dusty desert backgrounds with orange-hued skies
2. WHEN vehicles are shown THEN they SHALL appear weathered and worn with gritty textures
3. WHEN zombies appear THEN they SHALL be green or grey with ragged clothing and flailing animations when hit
4. WHEN the UI is displayed THEN it SHALL have a minimal, rugged design with mechanical sound effects
5. WHEN the game maintains THEN it SHALL use a fixed side view with camera following the vehicle

### Requirement 8: Stage Progression System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to progress through multiple desert stages with different backdrops and increasing obstacle density, so that the game provides long-term challenge and variety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player starts THEN multiple stages SHALL be available with different desert backdrops
2. WHEN the player progresses THEN each stage SHALL have increasing obstacle density and difficulty
3. WHEN the player reaches the end of a stage THEN the next stage SHALL unlock for progression
4. WHEN stages are unlocked THEN the player SHALL only progress after upgrading enough to reach the far end
5. WHEN the final stage is completed THEN the player SHALL reach the evacuation point for the win condition

### Requirement 9: Audio Design and Feedback

2. WHEN zombies are present THEN they SHALL produce growling and moaning sound effects
3. WHEN upgrades are purchased THEN metal clank and mechanical sounds SHALL provide audio feedback
4. WHEN zombies are hit THEN satisfying crunch sounds SHALL play to reward successful impacts
5. WHEN the game plays THEN background music SHALL maintain a tense, gritty tone appropriate to the wasteland setting

### Requirement 10: Camera and Perspective System

**User Story:** As a player, I want a fixed side view camera that follows my vehicle and zooms slightly when airborne, so that I can clearly see the terrain and obstacles ahead.
