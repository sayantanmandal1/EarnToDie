# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The zombie car game is experiencing critical audio context management issues where audio nodes (GainNode, BiquadFilterNode, DynamicsCompressorNode) are being created after the audio context has been closed. This causes multiple console warnings and potentially degrades the audio experience. The system needs proper audio context lifecycle management to ensure audio nodes are created and connected only when the context is active.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game's audio system to work without console errors, so that I have a smooth gaming experience without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the audio context SHALL be properly managed throughout the application lifecycle
2. WHEN audio nodes are created THEN they SHALL only be created when the audio context is in a valid state
3. WHEN the audio context is closed THEN no new audio nodes SHALL be created
4. WHEN the game restarts or reloads THEN the audio context SHALL be properly reinitialized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper audio context state management, so that I can debug and maintain the audio system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audio context state changes THEN the system SHALL log appropriate state transitions
2. WHEN audio initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
3. WHEN audio nodes are being created THEN the system SHALL verify the context state first
4. WHEN the audio system encounters errors THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the game

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent audio performance, so that the game's audio doesn't cause browser warnings or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN there SHALL be no audio context related console warnings
2. WHEN audio processing chains are created THEN they SHALL be properly connected only in valid contexts
3. WHEN the browser suspends the audio context THEN the system SHALL handle resume operations correctly
4. WHEN multiple audio systems initialize THEN they SHALL coordinate to avoid context conflicts
